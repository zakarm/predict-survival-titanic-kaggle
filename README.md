# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
## Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster competition on Kaggle. The goal of the competition is to use machine learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.

## Data
The data used in this competition is split into two datasets: train.csv and test.csv. The train.csv dataset contains information about a subset of the passengers on board, including whether they survived or not. The test.csv dataset contains similar information but does not disclose whether the passengers survived. The goal is to use the train.csv data to train a model that can predict whether the passengers in the test.csv dataset survived.

## Methodology
I used two algorithms to make my predictions: Random Forest and k-NN (k-nearest neighbors). I trained both models on the train.csv dataset and used them to make predictions on the test.csv dataset. I achieved a score of 0.78468 on the Kaggle leaderboard.

## Results
My submission achieved a score of 0.78468 on the Kaggle leaderboard. This score is calculated based on the accuracy of my predictions on the test.csv dataset.

## Conclusion
This competition was a great opportunity to apply machine learning techniques to a real-world problem. I learned a lot about data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection while working on this project. In the future, I plan to continue experimenting with different algorithms and techniques to improve my score.
